            <p class="tip-left">Dog anxiety has become a huge factor in this day and age. People working from home and being with your
                dog is great... <strong><em>Unitil,</em></strong> you go out and your dog suddenly starts losing its
                mind.<br><br>To counter this a good habit would be to have a crate, which will allow you to create that
                alone feeling for your puppy while you are at home. Then, when you leave the house over time your puppy
                will become used to being alone and it will be a much smalled shock to the system.</p>
