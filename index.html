                <h3>Anxiety</h3>
                <p>Dog anxiety has become a huge factor in this day and age. People working from home
                    and being with your
                    dog is great... <strong><em>Unitil,</em></strong> you go out and your dog suddenly starts losing its
                    mind.<br><br>To counter this a good habit would be to have a crate, which will allow you to create
                    that
                    alone feeling for your puppy while you are at home. Then, when you leave the house over time your
                    puppy
                    will become used to being alone and it will be a much smalled shock to the system.</p>

                <h3>Sleep/Rest</h3>
                <p>When it comes to sleep and rest it's really important that you give your puppy and good amount of it.
                    After a walk put your puppy in a crate to rest. After playing put your puppy in the crate to rest.
                    After food can be another good time to put your puppy in the crate to rest.<br>This will help in a
                    couple of different ways, it will teach them that the crate is not a bad place to go, it's a place
                    they can rest and calm down. It will help with the snappy biting, this usually happens when a puppy
                    is over tired.<br>Puppies are like babies,
                    it may sound obvious but its often over looked.</p>

                <h3>Toilet Training</h3>
                <p>Tired of finding puddles around your house?<br>Before you go out and buy puppy training pads, think
                    about
                    what you are teaching your puppy when you use them. You are teaching them it's ok to go to the
                    toilet in
                    the house, this really is the wrong approach. Instead, you need to be on the ball, take them outside
                    frequently and praise them when they supply the goods. Remember, if your puppy goes to the
                    toilet in the house, its your fault for not letting them outside often enough. You shouldn't be
                    telling
                    you puppy off, you should have a word with yourself and learn from it.</p>
