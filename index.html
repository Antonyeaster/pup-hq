                <h3>Anxiety</h3>
                <p class="tip-left">Dog anxiety has become a huge factor in this day and age. People working from home
                    and being with your
                    dog is great... <strong><em>Unitil,</em></strong> you go out and your dog suddenly starts losing its
                    mind.<br><br>To counter this a good habit would be to have a crate, which will allow you to create
                    that
                    alone feeling for your puppy while you are at home. Then, when you leave the house over time your
                    puppy
                    will become used to being alone and it will be a much smalled shock to the system.</p>
