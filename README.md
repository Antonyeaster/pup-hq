## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Colour Scheme](/documentation/colour-scheme.png)

The website uses a palette of pastel colours that are often used in the Bully Book Club logo images. The colour palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography 

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

* Jost is used for all headings
* Poppins is used for all body text

### Imagery

### Features

PUP HQ is a website is made up of 3 pages with a confirmation page accessible once a message has been sent. All these pages except the confirmation page are easily accessed through the navigation menu.

* All pages on the website:
  * A header which includes all the navigation for the page including, Home, Meet Up and Contact Us. The PUP HQ logo is also a direct link to the Home page. To keep the website running smoothly on smaller devices the navigation links will drop below the PUP HQ logo for a cleaner look.

  * A footer which includes all the links to our social media pages. These links are the correct logo representing the site they will take you to. When these links are clicked they will all open in a separate tab for better user experience. Also, to keep a clean look these logo links will become smaller on smaller devices.

* Confirmation page
  * Confirmation page. Includes a thank you message with the intention of getting a reply asap.

### Accessibilty

It's vital to make websites as accessible and easy to follow as possible. This has been achieved by:


  * Using semantic HTML
  * Using descriptive alt attributes on images
  * Using aria labels for links including naming the footer social media icons.
  * Using a colour contrast which is easy to see
  * Creating a shortcut to a differnt section of the page

## Testing

Testing was constantly being done throughout the whole build of the site. I used Chrome dev tool to help me identify the problems.

The following issues were raised durning my mid way project mentor meeting:

* The horizontal scroll bar was showing at the bottom of the screen at all times.
* More information needed on the Meet Up page to hint the user.
* Remove double spaces in my HTML code.
* Add more comments to HTML.

### W3C Validator

* [Index Page HTML](/documentation/index-w3c-validation.png)
* [Meet Up Page HTML](/documentation/meetup-w3c-validator.png)
* [Contact Us Page](/documentation/contactus-w3c-validator.png)
* [Confirmation Page](/documentation/confirmation-w3c-validator.png)
* [Style.css CSS](/documentation/css-w3c-validation.png)

### Solved Bugs

    1. The home page had a horizontal scroll bar which caused centreing issues for the whole page. I solved this by using Chrome Dev Tools to highlight the area which was wider then the page. Reducing the HTML min width solved this problem.
    2. The footer section overlapped the tips section above. I solved this with Chrome Dev Tools and realised I had put the opening footer HTML element in the section above.
    3. The live google map would become half the screen width but only on a mobile sized screen. I solved is by creating a media query with a max width css rule.
    4. The transparent text box in the hero image was to large on smaller screens and covered the whole image. The solution to this was to create a media query and resize all elements of the text box for smaller screens.
    5. The flip images would flip perfectly on Chrome Dev Tools with a mouse hover and a tap (touchscreen) however, once tested on an actual mobile device the flip boxes could only be flipped when a long press and hold was done, which caused the copy and paste menu to appear. The solution to this was to remove to 3d flip perspective in the css. This was plain trial and error to fix this.
    6. The gallery images on the home page would be out of line with the tip section above. I solved this by removing the padding in the media query.

### Known Bugs 

  1. Loading times and general performance on some desktop but mostly mobile devices can be a bit slow. The images would need to be compressed with compromising quality for this to improve.

### Testing User Stories

  * First Time Visitors
    * I want to know if PUP HQ can help with the problems I have. The information in this section are common problems people have with puppies from a young age.

![Left hero text area](/documentation/help-with-my-problems.png)

   * I want to find out where PUP HQ are located. The google map in the Meet Up section is the exact location where the club takes place. The (where to find us) link will also take the user to the Meet Up section. All of the flip images have the address on the back.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse in Chrome Dev Tools to test performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

### Index Page

Initial Lighthouse testing: [Lighthouse testing for mobile Home page - test 1](/documentation/testing/home-mobile-test-1.png) and [Lighthouse testing for desktop Home page - test 1](/documentation/testing/home-desktop-test-1.png)

Sugestions:

    1. Largest Contentful Paint element. Lighthouse suggested making the largest contentful paint element smaller on the home page I used [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to compress the image for better loading times.
    2. Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy. Lighthouse suggesed making a Cache Control time limit.

Final Lighthouse Testing:

![Home page mobile test](/documentation/testing/lighthouse-home-mobile-test.png)
![Home page desktop test](/documentation/testing/lighthouse-home-desktop-test.png)

Result

    1. Largest Contentful Paint element. The result of this did not increase my performance score, but made my image a lot more pixelated. I chose to keep the image file the original size.
    
    2. Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy. After doing a small amount of research on this I did try to add Cache Control but it made no difference to the score. Because of time restraints I made the decision to come back to this in the future.   

### Meet up Page 

Initial Light house testing: [Lighthouse testing for mobile Meet up page - test 1](/documentation/testing/meetup-mobile-test-1.png)
[Lighthouse testing for desktop Meet up page - test 1](/documentation/testing/meetup-desktop-test-1.png)

Sugestions:

     1. Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy. Lighthouse suggesed making a Cache Control time limit.

![Meet up page mobile test](/documentation/testing/lighthouse-meetup-mobile-test.png) 
![Meet up page desktop test](/documentation/testing/lighthouse-meetup-desktop-test.png)

Result:

     1. Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy, only on the mobile version. After doing a small amount of research on this I did try to add Cache Control but it made no difference to the score. Because of time restraints I made the decision to come back to this in the future.

### Contact us Page

Initial Light house testing: [Lighthouse testing for mobile Contact us page - test 1](/documentation/testing/contactus-mobile-test-1.png)

Result:

     1. Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy, only on the mobile version. After doing a small amount of research on this I did try to add Cache Control but it made no difference to the score. Because of time restraints I made the decision to come back to this in the future.

### Full Testing

To completly test my website I used multiple browsers including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Safari. Tested on devices such as, Iphone 14 Pro Max, Iphone 12 Pro, Ipad and HP laptop.

I also used Chrome Dev Tools to test each page at different sizes to test responsiveness.

Links.

     1. Test all the links in the header of all pages. They all worked as expected with clear indication to which page you are on.
     2. Test the Tips link on the Home page. The link worked as expected with it saving the user the need to scroll down.
     3. Test the links in the footer of every page. As they are all external links they worked as expected directing the user to a new browser tab.
     4. Test the "more options" link in the google map. The link works as expected directing the user to a new browser tab.

Contact us form:

     1. Test the contact us form. I attempted to submit the form without filling in any details. The form worked correctly and directed the user to fill in their first name. I then entered a name and attempted to submit the form again. The form worked correctly and directed the user to fill in the last name. I then filled in both first and last name and tried to submit the form again. The form worked correctly prompting the user to fill in the email address input. I then tried using an email address without the correct format. The form worked correctly and prompted the user the email address must use an @ symbol. After entering a correct email address. I tried to submit the form without including a message. The form worked correctly and instructed the user to enter a message. Once I entered a message I submitted the form. The form worked correctly and took me to the confirmation page within the same browser tab.

     2. I attempted to submit the form with just a email address entered. The form worked correcty and intructed the user to fill out the name inputs. Once I filled in the names and email the form requests the user to fill in the textarea. Once all the form is filled in the user is then directed to the confirmation page within the same browser tab.

     3. I attempted to submit the form without a message in the textarea. The form works correctly prompting the user to fill in the first name, last name, email address and then the textarea. Once these are all completed the user is directed to the confirmation page within the same browser tab. From here, the user can decide to go back if they wish with the navigation links within the header.
